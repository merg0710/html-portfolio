<h2>Top 3 fav films.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Jojo Rabit</h3>
<p>A WWII movie that is very different from any other WWII film. </p>
<h3>Close</h3>
<p>A film about intense friendship and the impact of bullying.</p>
<h3>Gattaca</h3>
<p>A film that shows that changes happen from within: the system is stronger than you, but you can hack  
    it if you play with its rules, instead of trying to go against it. </p>
